						<li>Fernando Alonso Díaz (born 29 July 1981) is a Spanish Formula One racing driver and a double World Champion.</li>
						<li>Born in Oviedo, the capital of the autonomous region of Asturias, Alonso started in karting from the age of 3.</li>
						<li> He made his Formula One debut in the 2001 season with Minardi, and then moved to the Renault team as a test driver the next year.</li>
						<li>On 25 September 2005, he won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship title at the age of 24 years and 58 days, at the time making him the youngest Formula One World Drivers' Champion.</li>
						<li>Alonso was the third-youngest driver ever to start a Formula One race when he made his debut with Minardi at the Australian Grand Prix. </li>
						<li>Alonso became test driver for Renault in 2002 – Renault having taken over the Benetton team – and did 1,642 laps of testing that year.</li>
						<li>Alonso remained with Renault for the 2004 season, scoring podiums in Australia, France, Germany and Hungary.</li>
						<li>For the 2005 season, Alonso was joined at Renault by Italian driver Giancarlo Fisichella. At the first race in Australia Alonso started near the back due to rain in qualifying but fought his way to third.</li>
						<li>Alonso became the youngest Drivers' Champion at the age of 24 years and 59 days old, breaking Emerson Fittipaldi's record. He also ended the five-year dominance of Michael Schumacher.</li>
						<li>In 2006, Alonso became the youngest double champion in the sport's history. Renault also clinched the Constructors' Championship with a 5-point gap over Ferrari.</li>
						<li>On 19 December 2005, Alonso announced that he would be moving to McLaren for 2007.</li>
						<li>Alonso went on to finish third in the drivers' championship, level on points with team-mate Hamilton and just one point behind World Champion Kimi Räikkönen, the closest 1–2–3 in WDC history.</li>
						<li>On 2 November 2007, after a turbulent year with McLaren, it was announced that McLaren and Alonso had mutually agreed to terminate his contract and that he would be free to join any team for 2008 without paying McLaren any compensation.</li>
						<li> On 10 December 2007, Alonso signed a two-year contract to drive for Renault alongside Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet Jr. for around £25 million.</li>
						<li>On 5 November, Flavio Briatore confirmed that Renault had agreed a two-year extension on Alonso's original contract, ending speculation about a supposed move to Ferrari, and a Renault contract "out-clause".</li>
						<li>In 2009, the new Renault R29 car did not meet up to Alonso's expectations at the start of the year, after it performed poorly in winter testing, despite the fact that there were no major reliability issues.</li>
						<li>He finished ninth in the drivers standings overall, scoring all of Renault's 26 points during the season. As a result, Renault only finished eighth in the constructors ahead of two other teams, Force India and Toro Rosso.</li>
						<li>After much speculation, on 30 September 2009, Alonso was confirmed to be replacing Kimi Räikkönen at the Ferrari team, partnering Felipe Massa.</li>
						<li>At the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi, Alonso entered the event with an eight-point lead, and qualified third. At the start of the race he lost a place to Button and then a strategic error by his team meant that Alonso spent the rest of the race stuck behind Vitaly Petrov, and lost out on world championship honours to Sebastian Vettel.</li>
						<li>A new rule for the 2014 season was that the drivers picked a unique car number they would use for the rest of their Formula One career. Alonso picked number 14 as he used the number in his karting career and considers it to be a lucky number.</li>
						<li>In November 2014 both Alonso and Scuderia Ferrari announced that the 2014 season would be his last with the team. In December 2014 it was announced that Alonso would return to McLaren for the first time since 2007</li>
